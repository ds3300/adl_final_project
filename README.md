# Applied Deep Learning Final Project

This is the GitHub repo for my final project of training an object character recognition CNN to extract and organize tabular data from a PDF. Project components and files include:

*   Code walkthrough video: https://youtu.be/94PXcvh3b2I
*   Notebook: https://github.com/ds3300/adl_final_project/blob/main/Final_Project.ipynb
*   Saved OCR model: https://github.com/ds3300/adl_final_project/tree/main/model
*   Model training history: https://github.com/ds3300/adl_final_project/blob/main/model_history
*   PDF text extraction tools: https://github.com/ds3300/adl_final_project/blob/main/pdf_text_extraction.py
*   PDF of tabular data used in this demonstration: https://github.com/ds3300/adl_final_project/blob/main/Southampton%20473605_2_pgs1-5.pdf
*   .ttf font files used to generate training data (source: https://fonts.google.com/)
